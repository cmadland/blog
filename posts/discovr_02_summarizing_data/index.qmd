## Frequency tables

- use `group_by()` and `summarise()` and `n()` functions from `dplyr`

 `group_by()`
 : groups data by whatever variable(s) you name within the function

 `summarise()`
 : creates summary table based on the variables in the function

`n()`
: counts the number of scores

To count frequencies:

- tell R to treat values that are the same, as being in the same category
  - `group_by(upload_day)` tells R that  scores that are the same within `upload_day` are in the same group
  - subsequent operations are conducted on the groups
- count how many scores fall into each category
  - `summarize()` creates a variable called `frequency` that counts how many items are in each group created by `group_by()`

```{r}
freq_tbl <- ice_tib |>
  dplyr::group_by(upload_day) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(
    frequency = n()
  )
freq_tbl
```

- this is a large table and a bit unwieldy
- use a `grouped frequency distribution`
  - place values of `upload_days` into bins
- if we want to split the variable `upload_day` into bins of 4 days...

```
ggplot2::cut_width(upload_day, 4)
```

- combine this with `dplyr::mutate()` to create a new variable called `days_group`

```{r}
gp_freq_dist <- ice_tib |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    days_group = ggplot2::cut_width(upload_day, 4)
    )
gp_freq_dist
```

- this creates a new object called `gp_freq_dist` that contains each value within `ice_tib` but with an extra column/variable called `days_group` that indicates the bin the value of `upload_day` is in
::: {.callout-note}
## Set notation
- the value of `upload_day` now has a corresponding value of `days_group` containing the bin
- the first score of 34 has been assigned to the bin labelled `(30, 34] which is the bin containing any score above 30, up to and including 34
- the label uses standard mathematical notation for sets where `(` or `)` means 'not including' and `[` or `]` means 'including'
:::

- now we can use `summarize()` and `n()` to count scores like before, except to use `days_group` instead of `upload_day`

### Coding challenge

Create a grouped frequency table called gp_freq_dist by starting with the code in the code example and then using the code we used to create freq_tbl to create a pipe that summarizes the grouped scores.


```{r}
gp_freq_dist <- ice_tib |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    days_group = ggplot2::cut_width(upload_day, 4)
    ) |>
  dplyr::group_by(days_group) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(
    frequency = n()
  )
gp_freq_dist
```

## Relative Frequencies

- we have an object `gp_freq_dist` that contains the number of days grouped into bins of 4 days and the number of videos uploaded during each of the time periods represented by those bins
- to calculate the relative frequency we can use `dplyr::mutate()` to add a variable that divides the frequency by the total number of videos using `sum()`

```
... |>
    dplyr::mutate(
        relative_freq = frequency/sum(frequency) # creates a new column
    )
```

## Efficient Code

- rather than creating the table of relative frequencies step-by-step, it is usually more efficient to carry out the steps in one piece of code
- 
```{r}
gp_freq_dist <- ice_tib |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    days_group = ggplot2::cut_width(upload_day, 4)
    ) |> 
  dplyr::group_by(days_group) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(
    frequency = n()
  ) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    relative_freq = frequency/sum(frequency),
    percent = relative_freq*100
  )
  
gp_freq_dist
```

## Histograms

- `ggplot2` can produce data visualizations

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip: Always load `ggplot2`!

We’ve discussed elsewhere that if you include packages when you use functions (e.g., `dplyr::mutate()`) you don’t need to explicitly load the package (in this case `dplyr`). However, to create plots with `ggplot2` you build them up layer by layer, which means you use a lot of `ggplot2` functions. For this reason, I advise loading it at the start of your Quarto document and not worrying too much about including package references when you use functions. You can load it either with `library(ggplot2)` or by loading the entire tidyverse using `library(tidyverse)`.
:::

- general form of `ggplot2`

```
`ggplot2::ggplot(my_tib, aes(variable_for_x_axis, variable_for_y_axis))`
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(ice_tib, aes(upload_day))
```

- something is missing b/c we only told `ggplot2` 'what' to plot, not 'how' to plot it.
- need to add a `geom` with `geom_histogram()`

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(ice_tib, aes(upload_day)) +
geom_histogram()
```

### Changing bin widths

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(ice_tib, aes(upload_day)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

### Changing colours

- include `fill =` within the `geom_histogram()` function

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(ice_tib, aes(upload_day)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#440154")
```

### Transparency and axis labels

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(ice_tib, aes(upload_day)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#440154", alpha = 0.25) +
labs(y = "Frequency", x = "Days since first ice bucket challenge video")
```

### Themes

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(ice_tib, aes(upload_day)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#440154", alpha = 0.9) +
labs(y = "Frequency", x = "Days since first ice bucket challenge video") +
theme_minimal()
```
