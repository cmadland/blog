# Fitting the Linear Model

- scatterplots to get an idea of whether assumption of linearity is met, look for outliers or other unusual cases
- run an initial regression and save the diagnostics
- if we want to generalize or test for significance or confidence intervals...
  - examine residuals for homoscedasticity, independence, normality, and linearity
    - lack of linearity --> fit a non-linear model
    - assumptions met and no bias --> Model can be generalized
    - lack of independent errors --> multi-level model
    - all other situations --> fit a robust version of the model using bootstrapping (small samples) or robust standard errors

```{r}
album_tib
```

- Use `GGally::ggscatmat` package to visualize the data
- produces 
  - a matrix of scatterplots below the diagonal
  - distributions along the diagonal
  - the correlation coefficient above the diagonal

```{r}
GGally::ggscatmat(album_tib, columns = c("adverts", "airplay", "image", "sales"))  +
theme_minimal()
```

## Interpretation

- 3 predictors have reasonably linear relationships with album sales and no obvious outliers (except bottom left of 'band image' scatterplots)
- across the diagonal (distributions)
  - advertising is very skewed
  - airplay and sales look heavy-tailed
- correlations in the plot give us an idea of the relationships between predictors and outcome
- if we ignore album sales, the highest correlation is between image ratings and amount of airplay, which is significant and the 0.01 level ($r=0.18$)
- focussing on the outcome variable, adverts and airplay correlate best with the outcome ($r=0.58$ and $r=0.6$)

## One predictor
### Fitting the model

- predicting sales from advertising alone

$$Y_i=b_0+{b_1}{X_i}+\epsilon_i$$

$$\text{Sales}_i=b_0+{b_1}{\text{Advertising}_i}+\epsilon_i$$

- it is clear from the bottom left scatterplot and the correlation ($r=0.58$) that a positive relation exists. More advertising money spent leads to greater album sales.
- some albums sell well regardless of advertising (top-left of scatterplot)
- no albums sell badly when adverts are high (bottom-right of scatterplot)
- to fit a linear model, we use `lm()` function
`my_model <- lm(outcome ~ predictor(s), data = tibble, na.action = an action)`
  - `my_model` is the name of the model
  - `outcome` is the name of the outcome variable (sales)
  - `predictor` is the name of the predictor variable (adverts) or, a list of variables separated by `+` symbols
  - `tibble` is the name of the tibble containing the data (album_tib)
- this function maps directly to the equation for the model
  - `adverts ~ sales` maps to $\text{Sales}_i=b_0+{b_1}{\text{Advertising}_i}+\epsilon_i$ except we ignore the error term and parameter estimates and we replace the `= ` with `~` (which means 'predicted from')

```{r}
album_lm <- lm(sales ~ adverts, data = album_tib, na.action = na.exclude)
summary(album_lm)
