## When to use factor analysis (p. 571)

- when attempting to measure latent variables
- factor analysis and principal component analysis are used to identify clusters of variables
- 3 main uses
  - understand the structure of a set of variables
  - to construct a questionnaire to measure an underlying variable
  - reduce the size of a data set while retaining as much of the original information as possible
    - (FA can be used to solve the problem of multicollinearity by combining factors that are collinear)

::: {.callout}
`multicollinearity`
: exists when there is a strong correlation between two factors
: multicollinearity makes it difficult or impossible to determine the amount of variance accounted for by one of two correlated factors
: e.g., if a factor predicts the outcome variable with $R=0.80$ and a second variable accounts for *the same variance* (i.e., it is highly correlated to the first variable) then it is only contributing to a very small amount of the unique variance in outcome and we might see $R=0.82$. If the two predictor variables are uncorrelated, then the second variable is contributing more unique variance and we might see $R=0.95$
: multicollinearity leads to interchangable predictors

### Examples of factor analysis

- extroversion, introversion, neuroticism traits
- personality questionnaires
- in economics to see whether productivity, profits, and workforce contribute to the underlying dimension of company growth

### EFA and PCA

- they are not the same thing
- but they both are used to reduce a set of variables into a smaller set of dimensions (factors in EFA, and components in PCA)
