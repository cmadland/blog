  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a new framework for understanding technology-integrated assessment in higher education based on a review of the literature using the assessment design in a digital world framework (Bearman et al., 2022) as a lens. Our review (Madland et al., 2024) revealed both congruities and incongruities between the literature and the framework, leading to the need for further work to accurately conceptualize technology-integrated assessment. In this article, we contribute to the literature on technology-integrated assessment in higher education by proposing the technology-integrated assessment framework. This paper marks an important step in extending our understanding of the factors influencing instructors who integrate technology into their assessment practice and promoting ethical and equitable approaches to technology-integrated assessment in higher education.},

Specifically, the paper focuses on (a) describing the assessment design in a digital world framework, (b) identifying the scope and breadth of the literature relating to technology-integrated assessment, and (c) highlighting any gaps between the Bearman et al.~model and the literature. This paper marks an important step in extending our understanding of the factors influencing instructors who integrate technology into their assessment practice and promoting ethical and equitable approaches to technology-integrated assessment in higher education.},
