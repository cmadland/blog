## 3 components of the Grammar or Graphiics

- `data`: the dataset containing the variables of interest.
- `geom`: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars.
- `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.

### Other components

- `facet`  to break up a plot into several plots split by the values of another variable (Section 2.6)
- position adjustments for barplots (Section 2.8)

### Five Named graphs - 5NG

1. Scatterplots
2. line graphs
3. bar graphs
4. histograms
5. boxplots


#### Scatterplots

Used to see the relationship between two numerical variables.

```{r}
View(envoy_flights)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- there is a problem of the points overlapping
  - change transparency with `alpha` argument


```{r}
ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

- add jitter

```{r}
ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30)
```

#### Linegraphs

Show the relationship between two variables when the x-axis (explanatory variable) is sequential.

```{r}
View(weather)
```

```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = early_january_2023_weather, 
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_line()
```

#### Histograms

Shows the distribution of a variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "steelblue")
```

##### adjusting bins

- number of bins

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white")
```

- binwidth

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white")
```

#### Facets

Dividing plots by subcategories in the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ month)
```

#### Boxplots

Display the distribution of data and include five numbers to summarize the data:

- minimum
- first quartile (25th percentile)
- median (2nd quartile, 50th percentile)
- third quartile (75th percentile)
- maximum
- also shows the IQR (middle 50%)
  - whiskers extend no more than 1.5 IQR units beyond 25th and 75 percentile.
  - points beyond 1.5 IQR units may be considered outliers.



```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

::: {.callout-note}
Returns an invalid plot and a warning.
:::

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = wind_speed, group = month)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```
OR

- represent months as factors and use `geom(violin)` for a more detailed plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_violin()
```

#### Barplots

Simpler representation of the distribution known as `frequencxies`
- depends on whether the items are counted or not.

```{r}
fruits <- tibble(fruit = c("apple", "apple", "orange", "apple", "orange"))
fruits_counted <- tibble(
  fruit = c("apple", "orange"),
  number = c(3, 2))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = fruits, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number)) +
  geom_col()
```

- when items are not counted, use `geom_bar()` with `fruit` mapped to the x `aes`
- when items are counted, we add `number` to the y `aes` and use `geom_col()`

```{r}
ggplot(flights,  aes(x = carrier)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- `geom_histogram()` has bars that touch, but `geom_bar()` has bars with white space between

```{r}
View(airlines)
```

::: {.callout-important}
[The best pie-chart is a bar-chart.](https://moderndive.com/v2/viz.html#must-avoid-pie-charts)
:::

##### Stacked Barplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar()

```

##### Dodged Barplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma")
```
