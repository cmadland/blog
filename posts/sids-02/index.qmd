## 3 components of the Grammar or Graphiics

- `data`: the dataset containing the variables of interest.
- `geom`: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars.
- `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.

### Other components

- faceting breaks up a plot into several plots split by the values of another variable (Section 2.6)
- position adjustments for barplots (Section 2.8)

### Five Named graphs - 5NG

1. Scatterplots
2. line graphs
3. bar graphs
4. histograms
5. boxplots


#### Scatterplots

Used to see the relationship between two numerical variables.

```{r}
View(envoy_flights)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- there is a problem of the points overlapping
  - change transparency with `alpha` argument


```{r}
ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

- add jitter

```{r}
ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30)
```

#### Linegraphs

Show the relationship between two variables when the x-axis (explanatory variable) is sequential.

```{r}
View(weather)
```

```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = early_january_2023_weather, 
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_line()
```

#### Histograms

Shows the distribution of a variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "steelblue")
```

##### adjusting bins

- number of bins

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white")
```

- binwidth

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white")
```

#### Facets

Dividing plots by subcategories in the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ month)
```
