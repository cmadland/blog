## Which of the following describes tidy data?

Data that are arranged such that scores on a variable appear in a single column and rows represent a combination of the attributes of those scores – the entity from which the scores came, when the score was recorded, etc. Scores from a single entity can appear over multiple rows where each row represents a combination of the attributes of the score – for example, levels of an independent variable or time point at which the score was recorded.

## Are the download data in tidy or messy format?
Messy

Correct - well done! The download data are messy because the hygiene scores on different days are spread across different columns rather than being in a single colum with an additional column to indicate the day of the festival that the hygiene score was measured.
:::

`tidyr` has two functions for converting data from messy to tidy.
- `pivot_longer()` takes columns and puts them into rosw to make messy data tidy
- `pivot_wider()` takes rows and puts them in columns to make tidy data messy

## Making messy data tidy

```
tidyr::pivot_longer(
  data = tibble,
  cols = column_names,
  names_to = "name_of_column_to_contain_variable_names",
  values_to = "name_of_column_to_contain_values",
)
```

`tibble`
:  Name of the messy tibble

`column_names`
:  list of columns to be restructured into rows

`names_to`
:  name for the new variable that contains names of the original columns

`value_to`
: name for the new variable that will contain the values.

## Code example

- in `download_tib`, there are three columns/variables that need to be restructured into rows
- specify the variables using `day_1:day_3`
- scores in these columns represent hygiene scores, so we could use `hygiene` as the variable to contain values after restructuring
- columns we are transforming represent different days at the festival, so we can use `day` as the name of the variable created to contain column names

```{r}
download_tidy_tib <- download_tib |>  # create a new object called `download_tidy_tib`
  tidyr::pivot_longer(                              # use the `pivot_longer()` function from `tidyr`
  cols = day_1:day_3,                           # specify columns `day_1:day_3` for restructuring
  names_to = "day",                             # names of the columns be placed in a variable called `day`
  values_to = "hygiene",                        # values of the columns placed in a variable called `hygiene`
)
download_tidy_tib                               # display the new object
```

## Tidying labels

- the values in `day` match the original column names exactly (`day_1`)
- we want sentence case (`Day 1`)
- use `stringr`
```
download_tidy_tib <- download_tidy_tib |>   # recreates `download_tidy_tib` from itself
   dplyr::mutate(                                             # uses `dplyr::mutate` to recreate the variable `day`
    day = stringr::str_to_sentence(day) |> stringr::str_replace("_", " ")                                                # uses `stringr::str_to_sentence` to capitalize the d, then `str_replace()` to find the underscore and replace it with a space
  )
  ```

```{r}
download_tidy_tib <- download_tidy_tib |> 
   dplyr::mutate(
    day = stringr::str_to_sentence(day) |> stringr::str_replace("_", " ")
  )
  download_tidy_tib
```

  ## Making tidy data messy

- `pivot_wider()` reverses the process above

```
tidyr::pivot_wider(
  data = tibble,  # tibble to be restructured
  id_cols = variables_that_you_do_not_want_to_restructure,
  names_from = "variable_containing_the_names_of_columns",
  values_from = " variable_containing_the_scores",
)
```

```{r}
download_tib <- download_tidy_tib |> 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
  id_cols = c(ticket_no, gender),
  names_from = "day",
  values_from = "hygiene",
)
download_tib
```

- in this case, having the variable names in sentence case (Day 1), is inconvenient because we will always have to put them in backticks
- rename using `dplyr::rename_with`

```{r}
download_tib <- download_tib |> 
  dplyr::rename_with(.cols = starts_with("Day"), # finds all columns w/i download_tib that begin with the word `Day'
     .fn = \(column) stringr::str_replace(string = column, # creates a lambda or anonymous function that will be applied to the variables that begin with Day
        pattern = "Day ",  # with next line, tells the function what to do
        replacement = "day_")
)

download_tib
```

## Spotting outliers

Two ways:

- visualize the data and look for unusual cases
- look for values that are poorly predicted by the model, using model residuals as described in DSUR

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
## What are the model residuals?

- The differences between the values a model predicts and the values observed in the data on which the model is based
