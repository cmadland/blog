    "text": "Activities\nIn a survey that included assessment of husband and wife heights, Hodges, Krech and Crutchfield (1975) reported the following results. Let’s treat wife height as the predictor (X) variable and husband as the outcome (Y) variable:\n\\(r_XY\\) = .32, \\(N\\) = 1, 296\nWife height: \\(M_X\\) = 64.42, \\(S_X\\) = 2.56\nHusband height: \\(M_Y\\) = 70.46, \\(S_Y\\) = 2.87\na. Calculates the values of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) to predict husband height in inches (Y) from wife height in inches (X), and write out this raw score predictive equation\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=r\\frac{S_Y}{S_X}\\]\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=.32\\frac{2.87}{2.56}\\]\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=0.35\\]\n\\[b_0=M_Y-\\hat{b_1}M_X\\]\n\\[b_0=70.46-(0.35*64.42)\\]\n\\[b_0=70.46-22.54\\]\n\\[b_0=47.91\\]\nPredictive Equation \\[\\hat{Y}=b_0+{b_1}{X_i}\\] \\[\\hat{Y}=47.91+(0.35*{X_i})\\]\n\nFor women: what is your own height? Substitute your own height into the equation from step a, and calculate the predicted height of your present or future spouse.\n\n\\[\\hat{Y}=47.91+(0.35*67)\\]\n\\[\\hat{Y}=71.36\\]\n\nNow reverse the roles of the variables (i.e., use husband height as the predictor and wife height as the outcome variable). Calculates the values of bb0 and bb1.\n\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=r\\frac{S_Y}{S_X}\\]\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=.32\\frac{2.56}{2.87}\\]\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=.32*.89\\]\n\\[\\hat{b_1}=.28\\]\n\\[b_0=M_Y-\\hat{b_1}M_X\\]\n\\[b_0=64.42-(0.28*70.46)\\]\n\\[b_0=64.42-19.72\\]\n\\[b_0=44.7\\]\n\\[\\hat{Y}=44.7+(0.28*{X_i})\\]\n\nFor men: what is your height in inches? Substitute your own height into the equation from step c, and calculate the predicted height of your present or future spouse.\n\n\\[\\hat{Y}=44.7+(0.28*70)\\]\n\\[\\hat{Y}=64.3\\]\n\nWhat proportion of variance in husband height is predictable from wife height? Test the significance of the regression equation.\n\n\\[r^2=.10\\]\n\nIf both X and Y have been standardized by transforming into Z scores before calculating the regression coefficients, what would be the values of bb0 and bb1 to predict husband height in inches (Y) from wife height in inches (X)? How does this standardized version of the prediction equation tell us about “regression toward the mean” for predictions?\n\n\\[\\hat{Z_{Y_i}}=\\beta{Z_{X_i}}\\]\n\\[\\hat{2.87}=0.32{2.56}\\]"
